## Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing Tensorflow libraries

The Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (**NuPIC**) is a machine intelligence platform that implements the [HTM learning algorithms](https://numenta.com/resources/papers-videos-and-more/).  For more information, see [numenta.org](http://numenta.org) or [HTM Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/c/engineering/machine-learning).

This library integrates selected neuroscience principles from HTM into the [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/) deep learning platform.
